# ðŸ“œ Flutter Scroll Notification Examples

This project is a **collection of practical Flutter examples** that demonstrate how to use [`NotificationListener<ScrollNotification>`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NotificationListener-class.html) to build smooth, interactive, and responsive UI features.

These examples are designed to help Flutter developers understand **how to react to scrolling**, trigger animations, and enhance user experience based on scroll position and direction.
